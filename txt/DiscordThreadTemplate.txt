## Reply

If you're ever looking for more information about a native action, Matthew Cassinelli maintains an Action Directory: https://matthewcassinelli.com/actions/view-content-graph

I made a little "utility" for it. All it does is append asked input to the URL format and yet I find myself using it all the time lol. https://routinehub.co/shortcut/10921/

Just to be clear, though, I *do not* want to discourage asking questions like this, here. Threads dedicated to individual native actions are actually a great idea.

## OP

`ChesterWOV#4052`

[10112022-060900](https://discord.com/channels/503976650439131183/1029350069096431666/1029350069096431666)

What does the **View Content Graph** action do?

When I saw "Content Graph", I thought maybe it shows a dictionary structure. However, it just showed a bunch of "text", "boolean", "PDF" etc..

So what does this actually do? Thank you.
